Come up with a fabricated idea that would change the course of human development, you think you have got all that potential to put an excellent idea in the form of a working model. But,</p>
    <div class="quotes"><em>‘Waiting for an opportunity.... The wait is over now’</em></div>
    <p class="Description">TIC presents you a wonderful platform where you can showcase your innovative ideas in the form of a model, prototype, patent, cool apps or any software product in front of elegant Panel of Judges. It’s time to think ‘out of the box’. Let the budding Einstein inside you take over, fire up your grey matter, and show the world what you are capable of.</p>
