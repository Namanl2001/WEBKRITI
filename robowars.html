    <div class="Description">
        The ultimate test of engineering excellence, teamwork, strategy, and gaming is here! Infotsav brings to you its flagship event, Robowars. Witness the brightest engineers in India build the mightiest monsters which shall unleash Armageddon on the battle turf!
Each team has to come up with a wirelessly controlled robot capable of a one on one and trio combat. With pneumatic pincers, mighty armors, nifty axes and more innovative weapons, these merciless mercenaries shall fight for the glory of their makers, upholders of the dignity of their institutions. The law of the jungle, of 'might is right,' shall prevail. Only the toughest shall survive! Sparks shall fly, and temperatures shall soar high this Infotsav’20! Be there to witness the raw aggression, the crude violence of these mean machines as they rip each other apart!
